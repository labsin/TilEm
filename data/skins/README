** About the format : **

When I started to work on tilem 2, I firstly decided to use the old tilem format (4 pixs around a lcd).
But that's not a good idea, and the new skin creation is too hard like this ... :(

Finally, we (with Benjamin) have choosen the Tiemu skin format:
This format consists in a binary file containing skin information (author, name, model, size etc...) and in the second part :the image data.
With this format, it becomes really simple and fun to create a skin.
Tiemu Skinedit works perfectly for tilem 2 (how do you think I 've created these "officials skins :P).
I hope this new format will pleased to you.

Thank you Julien Blache for his help and his authorization to use Tiemu skin format and skinops.c/skinops.h files.
Thank you Romain Lievin too.
