                           Installing TilEm
                          ------------------

To compile TilEm, you will need:

  * a standard C compiler

  * the GTK+ library, version 2.6.0 or later

  * the libticalcs2 library (part of the TiLP project), and its
    dependencies (libticables2, libtifiles2, and libticonv)

  * (optional, needed for sound support) the SDL library

Some OS distributions package the "development files" separately from
the libraries themselves; you need both.  If you are using Debian (or
a related distribution, such as Ubuntu or Mint), install the packages
'build-essential', 'libticalcs-dev', 'libgtk2.0-dev', and
'libsdl1.2-dev'.

If these packages aren't available from your package manager, you'll
need to compile them yourself; see the TiLP website for more
information (http://lpg.ticalc.org/prj_tilp/).

Mac OS X has not been tested by the TilEm team, but if TiLP works,
TilEm should, too.  Please let us know if you do get it to work.

Once the above dependencies are installed, open a terminal and 'cd' to
the directory containing this INSTALL file.  Then run

   ./configure

which will check whether you have all of the necessary software
installed, and figure out how to compile TilEm for your particular
system.  If configure is successful, you can then run

   make

to compile TilEm.  Finally, you can run

   sudo make install

to install it (or run 'make install' as the superuser.)  The program
will be installed in '/usr/local/bin/', and data files will be
installed in '/usr/local/share/tilem2/'.  Alternatively, you can run

   make install-home

to install TilEm in your own home directory ('$HOME/bin/', with data
files stored in '$HOME/.local/share/tilem2/'), which does not require
superuser privileges.  (If $HOME/bin didn't exist already, you might
have to run 'export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH', or log out and log back in,
before running TilEm.)

Once TilEm is installed, start it by running 'tilem2', or through your
system's applications menu.
